# createProj
This program is designed to automatically create GitHub projects with a single command in Windows!!!
It can be stored in any directory but is reccomended to be stored in the C:\ directory.
For ease of use, add the folder to your path, which will then allow you to simply call "createProj projName projType".
The two Project Types are Python, and DNCWebsite, (Which creates a dotnet core website).
Your credentials will be stored locally in info.json, so there are no hard coded credentials for this application.
